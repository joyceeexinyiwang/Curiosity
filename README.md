# Curiosity

> Where is our *Agora* today?
>
> How is technology transforming the concept of the public and the social landscape upon which citizenry exists?
>
> To find sensible answers and to continue asking provocative questions, I'd like to explore existing lines of inquiry across philosophy, sociology, history, media studies, politics, computer science, and more.

#### Directions???

- Through research and activism, develop knolwedge base in research related to media, technology, and society
  - From sociological, philosophical, and scientific standpoint
- Conceptual exercises through creative practice and writing
- How to assert the emotional capacity that defines us as humans Ãºas the world becomes more opaque and mechanical with the growth of technologies?

*Right now, I strive to use research and creative practice as vehicles for activism*
