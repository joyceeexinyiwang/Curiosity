#### Directions???

- Through research and activism, develop knolwedge base in research related to media, technology, and society
  - From sociological, philosophical, and scientific standpoint
- Conceptual exercises through creative practice and writing
- How to assert the emotional capacity that defines us as humans Ãºas the world becomes more opaque and mechanical with the growth of technologies?

*Right now, I strive to use research and creative practice as vehicles for activism*
